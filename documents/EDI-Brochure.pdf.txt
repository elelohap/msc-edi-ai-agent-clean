NUS National University of Singapore College of Design and Engineering Master of Science Engineering Design and Innovation Ready to Design the Future and Engineer Change? Innovation begins with curiosity -the ability to see challenges from new perspectives and transform them into opportunities. The Master of Science in Engineering Design & Innovation (MSc EDI) at NUS equips you with the mindset and skills to create meaningful impact through design and engineering. Grounded in experiential learning, the programme brings together talented individuals from diverse disciplines to collaborate with experts and community partners. In this immersive, hands-on journey, you will learn to design and engineer with purpose -and shape a better tomorrow. KEY BENEFITS Collaborate effectively across disciplines to design solutions that address real-world challenges. Expand your perspectives by integrating insights from diverse fields beyond your core expertise. Think broadly and explore deeply what truly matters to people, communities, and society. Apply creativity and critical thinking to tackle complex design and engineering problems. Gain essential knowledge in product development, systems thinking, and innovation processes. Understand the balance of desirability, feasibility, and viability that drives successful product innovation. CURRICULUM The MSc in Engineering Design & Innovation is structured as an immersive, project-based programme that blends design thinking, engineering rigour, and innovation strategy. The curriculum is designed to help you build both depth in technical knowledge and breadth in creative problem-solving. Students engage in a mix of studio-based learning, community collaborations, and hands-on projects, working closely with faculty mentors and peers from diverse disciplines. Through these experiences, you will learn to frame complex problems, prototype and test solutions, and deliver innovations that are desirable, feasible, and viable. The programme comprises core modules that establish a foundation in design methodology, product development, engineering systems, entrepreneurship and innovation management, complemented by elective courses that allow you to explore areas such as emerging technologies, sustainable design, and venture creation. A major component of the curriculum is the year-long Interdisciplinary Design Project, where students work in multi-disciplinary teams to solve real-world challenges in partnership with community stakeholders -translating ideas into tangible impact.
